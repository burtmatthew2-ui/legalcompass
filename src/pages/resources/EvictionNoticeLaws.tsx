                  <strong>What makes this guide unique:</strong> Eviction laws vary wildly—from 3-day notices in Texas to 90-day protections in parts of New York. Unlike generic eviction articles, we focus equally on tenant defenses like improper notice, retaliation, and habitability issues that can stop evictions cold.

              <p>
                An eviction notice is scary, but it doesn't mean you're out tomorrow. Eviction is a formal legal process with strict rules landlords must follow. From proper notice to proving their case in court, landlords who cut corners risk having their eviction dismissed. Here's what you need to know about your rights.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Types of Eviction Notices</h2>
              <p>
                Most states recognize several types of eviction notices, each with different timelines and requirements. <strong>Pay Rent or Quit notices</strong> give tenants a short period (typically 3-14 days) to pay overdue rent or vacate. <strong>Cure or Quit notices</strong> allow tenants time to fix a lease violation (like having an unauthorized pet) or move out. <strong>Unconditional Quit notices</strong> require immediate move-out, usually for serious lease violations or repeat offenses.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>No-Cause termination notices</strong> (for month-to-month tenancies) allow landlords to end tenancy without stating a reason, though they must provide 30-90 days' notice depending on the state and length of tenancy. Some states have "just cause" eviction protections that limit when landlords can terminate tenancies.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Notice Periods by State (Common Examples)</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>California:</strong> 3-day notice for nonpayment or lease violations, 30-day notice for month-to-month tenancies under one year, 60-day notice for tenancies over one year. Just-cause eviction protections apply to most properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Texas:</strong> 3-day notice for nonpayment of rent, 30-day notice for month-to-month tenancies. Texas has one of the fastest eviction processes in the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>New York:</strong> 14-day notice for nonpayment in most areas (3-day in some upstate counties), 30-day notice for month-to-month tenancies under one year, 90-day notice for tenancies over two years. NYC has additional protections under rent stabilization and good cause eviction laws.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Florida:</strong> 3-day notice for nonpayment (excluding weekends and holidays), 7-day notice for curable lease violations, 15-day notice for month-to-month termination.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Illinois:</strong> 5-day notice for nonpayment in Chicago (10 days for subsidized housing), 30-day notice for month-to-month termination. Cook County has additional just-cause eviction protections.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Proper Service Requirements</h2>
              <p>
                Eviction notices must be properly served to be legally valid. Most states allow personal service (handing the notice directly to the tenant), substitute service (leaving it with another adult at the residence), or posting and mailing (taping notice to the door and mailing a copy). Some states require certified mail or allow service by a process server or sheriff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The notice period doesn't start until proper service is completed. If service is improper, the entire eviction can be dismissed. Always document when and how you received notice—take photos of posted notices and keep copies of all mailings.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tenant Defenses to Eviction</h2>
              <p>
                Even after receiving an eviction notice, tenants have several potential defenses. <strong>Improper notice</strong>—if the landlord didn't follow state-required notice procedures, the eviction may be invalid. <strong>Retaliation</strong>—landlords cannot evict tenants for exercising legal rights like requesting repairs or reporting code violations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Discrimination</strong>—evictions based on protected characteristics (race, religion, family status, disability) violate federal and state fair housing laws. <strong>Breach of warranty of habitability</strong>—if the landlord failed to maintain the property in livable condition, you may have a defense or counterclaim. <strong>Rent already paid</strong>—provide proof of payment if the eviction is based on nonpayment.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">COVID-19 and Eviction Protections</h2>
              <p>
                While the federal eviction moratorium has ended, many states and cities maintain additional protections. Some jurisdictions still require landlords to inform tenants about rental assistance programs before filing eviction. Check your local housing authority's website for current emergency protections and rental assistance programs.
              </p>
