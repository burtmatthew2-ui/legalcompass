    category: "Court",
    description: "Step-by-step guide to filing in small claims court",
    content: `SMALL CLAIMS COURT: COMPLETE FILING GUIDE

WHAT IS SMALL CLAIMS COURT?
Small claims court is designed for people to resolve disputes without lawyers. It handles cases involving smaller amounts of money (limits vary by state: typically $2,500 - $25,000).

COMMON SMALL CLAIMS CASES:
✓ Security deposit disputes
✓ Unpaid debts or loans
✓ Property damage
✓ Breach of contract
✓ Unpaid wages
✓ Consumer disputes (defective products, poor services)

---

STEP 1: DETERMINE IF YOU HAVE A CASE

Ask yourself:
• Do I have evidence (contracts, receipts, photos, texts, emails)?
• Is the amount within my state's small claims limit?
• Do I know where the defendant lives or does business?
• Has the statute of limitations passed? (Usually 2-4 years depending on claim type)

---

STEP 2: SEND A DEMAND LETTER (REQUIRED IN MANY STATES)

Before filing, send a written demand letter to the defendant:
• State what they owe you and why
• Include a deadline for payment (typically 10-30 days)
• State you will file in small claims court if not resolved
• Send via certified mail with return receipt

---

STEP 3: GATHER YOUR EVIDENCE

Collect and organize:
📄 Contracts, agreements, or leases
💰 Receipts, invoices, or payment records
📧 Emails, text messages, letters
📸 Photographs or videos
👥 Witness statements or contact information
📊 Estimates, appraisals, or expert opinions

---

STEP 4: FILE YOUR CLAIM

Visit your local courthouse or court website to:
• Obtain the "Plaintiff's Claim" form (or file online)
• Complete all required information accurately
• Pay the filing fee ($30-$100 depending on claim amount)
• File multiple copies (usually 3: court, defendant, your records)

INFORMATION YOU'LL NEED:
• Defendant's full legal name
• Defendant's address (home or business)
• Exact amount you're claiming
• Clear description of your claim
• Date the problem occurred

---

STEP 5: SERVE THE DEFENDANT

The defendant must be legally "served" (officially notified):
• You CANNOT serve papers yourself
• Options: Sheriff, professional process server, certified mail (in some states)
• Cost: $30-$75 typically
• Proof of service must be filed with the court

---

STEP 6: PREPARE FOR YOUR COURT DATE

The court will mail you a hearing date (usually 30-90 days after filing).

HOW TO PREPARE:
✓ Organize evidence chronologically
✓ Create a timeline of events
✓ Practice explaining your case in 5 minutes or less
✓ Bring 3 copies of all evidence (judge, defendant, yourself)
✓ Dress professionally
✓ Arrive 15-30 minutes early
✓ Bring any witnesses

---

STEP 7: PRESENT YOUR CASE IN COURT

WHAT TO EXPECT:
• No lawyers (in most states)
• Informal setting
• Judge will ask questions
• You'll have 10-20 minutes to present
• Defendant will respond
• Judge may ask follow-up questions

HOW TO PRESENT:
1. Address the judge as "Your Honor"
2. State your case clearly and factually
3. Avoid emotional arguments
4. Present evidence when asked
5. Answer questions directly
6. Remain calm and respectful

---

STEP 8: THE JUDGMENT

The judge will either:
• Decide immediately (same day)
• Mail the decision within 7-30 days

IF YOU WIN:
• You'll receive a judgment for the amount awarded
• The defendant has time to pay (varies by state)
• If they don't pay, you may need to collect (see Step 9)

IF YOU LOSE:
• Some states allow appeals (limited grounds)
• Usually, the decision is final

---

STEP 9: COLLECTING YOUR JUDGMENT (IF YOU WIN)

If the defendant doesn't pay voluntarily:
• Wage garnishment (take money from paycheck)
• Bank levy (freeze and take money from bank account)
• Property lien (place claim on property or vehicle)
• Request payment plan from court

Note: Collecting can be challenging. Research defendant's assets before filing.
